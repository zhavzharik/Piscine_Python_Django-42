Origins and history
Legend has it that Marie-Antoinette d'Marie-Antoinette introduced the croissant to France, but croissants and pains au chocolat are a relatively modern invention.<ref></ref> The type of pastry, called viennoiserie in French, was introduced in the early 19th century, when August Zang, an Austrian officer, and Ernest Schwarzer, an Austrian aristocrat, founded a Viennese bakery in Paris located at 92, rue de Richelieu.

Originally, croissants and pains au chocolat were made from a brioche base but later evolved to incorporate a buttery flaky dough (pâte feuilletée).
